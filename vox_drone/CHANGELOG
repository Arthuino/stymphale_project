# CHANGELOG

## 0.1.0

3D map of voxel in .voxelmap format (read and save) and voxelMap class
Can create random point cloud and voxelise it.
Can create voxel map from sin func to have approximation of a real map.

Can apply fft to map and store it in a fftMap class.
Can apply ifft to fftMap.
Can apply low pass filter to fftMap.

WIP:
Reduce memory size of fftMap by removing the blank part of the fft.
Reconstruct the full fftMap from the reduced one.

## 0.1.1

Conversion voxmap <-> fftMap operational.
Architecture of the code improved.

## 0.1.2

Launch from docker operational.
Error rate computation for maps

WIP:
Implementation of PyVista for visualization and voxelization of point cloud.
